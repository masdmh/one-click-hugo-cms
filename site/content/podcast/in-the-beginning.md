transcript: >-
  Although it can be challenging for us to go beyond the question “I wonder how
  we got here?”, it has many benefits to do so.         


  When you realize that you are in physically **and spiritually** listening to this podcast there are likely to be one of two reactions –                         


  Denial -  a desire to suppress the truth.    Or perhaps  “Awe” –and a desire to know more


  You can either say to Go,   


  “You are what I strive to flee”, or “You are what I strive to be.”


  Albert Einstein showed that space and time are interdependent - two parts of a single structure, which we call spacetime.  Material objects, or matter require spacetime in order to exist.  Every physical object has a location in space and time. 


  This interdependency between space, time and matter can be highlighted within our verse:


  In the beginning  (refers to TIME) God created the sky or heavens as is usually translated (referring to SPACE) and the earth (referring to MATTER).


  Therefore. the author of the book of Genesis is in accord with one of the greatest scientists who ever lived.    Biblical truth and Science in harmony because of the logical, orderly way the universe behaves reflecting the One who made it.    


  The spirals of a shell and also of a galaxy both reflect a predictable mathematical sequence, the Fibonacci series which demonstrates the orderly thinking of the Creator.  Listen now to four key aspects about God to help us understand what He is like.


   


  <!--\[if !supportLists]-->I.                    <!--\[endif]-->First, He is The God of Creation


  The Bible says “God is Spirit.”   This is necessary since if the universe had a beginning –  then time, space, and matter, didn’t exist before they existed. Therefore, whatever was before those things has no physical parts, …. no parts.   It also means that the Creator is pure Actuality – or no potential. If He had potential, then there would be change.  Change requires time and time exists only with space and matter. Therefore He simply is.    


  God said to Moses – “I AM WHO I AM”.


  God is prior to His creation, not **a part** of it.    In Isaiah 43 verse 10:


   “The Lord says, “You are my witnesses.\

      You are the servant I chose.\

  I chose you so you would know and believe me.\

      I chose you so you would understand that I am the true God.\

  There was no God before me,\

      and there will be no God after me.   


  And In Isaiah 40 verse 28 Isaiah records:


  Surely you know.\

      Surely you have heard.\

  The Lord is the God who lives forever.\

      He created all the world.\

  He does not become tired or need to rest.\

      No one can understand how great his wisdom is.          


  From these verses we can deduce that God exists, He is eternal, He is One, and He is Spirit –   the God of Creation is Monotheistic.


   


  <!--\[if !supportLists]-->II.                  <!--\[endif]-->Secondly, God is The God above Creation


   


  God is eternal, but not in the sense of time going from point to point, like seconds ticking on a clock. Instead, He simply is.  What we perceive as time is a part of what He has created and therefore He is above it.


   


  Time is merely a result of God’s desire to fellowship with His creatures.


   


   God created us out of nothing.  


   


  And the psalms say how God did it –


   


  The sky was made at the Lord’s command.\

      By the breath from his mouth, he made all the stars.\

  **7** He gathered the water in the sea into a heap.\

      He made the great ocean stay in its place.\

  **8** All the earth should worship the Lord.\

      The whole world should fear him.\

  **9** He spoke, and it happened.\

      He commanded, and it appeared.    Psalm 33:6-9”


   


  God simply spoke the universe into existence. As God doesn’t have a mouth, the psalmist used a metaphor to explain creation via the Word, or the Logos, which is Jesus Christ; the Word of God. In His infinite wisdom and from His very nature, He created something from nothing.


   


  Jesus claims that God is also the the sustainer of creation.


  In John 5:17  **17** … Jesus said to them, “My Father never stops working. And so I work, too[](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5&version=ICB "View Full Chapter")


   


   


  <!--\[if !supportLists]-->III.                <!--\[endif]-->Thirdly, God is The God in Creation


  Some of God’s attributes can be understood from His relationship to His creation.


  The God ***of*** creation is eternal and unchanging.\

  The God ***above*** creation is unlimited in intelligence, power, and place.\

  The ***God in Creation*** is present, active, and caring. He is committed to His creation and directs it for His purposes. These purposes have one ultimate goal – to bring Him the glory He deserves.


  When He spoke through the prophet Isaiah, He proclaimed this to His creatures:


  “I am the Lord. That is my name.\

      I will not give my glory to another.\

      I will not let idols take the praise that should be mine.


  Isaiah 42:8


  God is working today, even in your ear right now as you listen to His Word. 


  “In the beginning God created the sky and the earth.”


  God challenges you to accept the truthfulness of His Word and apply it to your own heart, personally.     




   


  <!--\[if !supportLists]-->IV.                <!--\[endif]-->Finally,  God is The Personal God


  The Personal God relates to His creation by His prophetic Word, breathed out and recorded by men and women of God.   His messages through these people reveal His very heart –


  “I love my creatures;”


  “I am angry at sin; “


  “I am merciful; “


  “I am just; “


  “I am righteous; “


  “I am holy; “


  “I am full of grace; “


  “I embody truth”.


  His personal messages reflect His personal nature. They also reflect His infinite worth –


  Praise the Lord.\

      He alone is great.\

      He is greater than heaven and earth.


  **Psalm 148:13**


  Jesus has opened up a new avenue for the people of the world if they are willing to simply call on Him -- He promises an eternity of joy and blessing.   God leaves the choice up to each of us. We can continue in denial down the path we’re on to eventual destruction and eternal separation from the Creator, or we can be reconciled to Him by believing that the Lord, Jesus Christ died and rose again for us. 


  As this episode ends, listen carefully as this is summarised in John 3:16.


  The personal God is willing you right now in the privacy of your own heart to strive to be like Him.  Simply accept this truth in your heart so that you may begin your personal relationship with the Personal God.


  “For God loved the \[…people of the…] world, \[…in other words YOU!...] so much that he gave his only Son. God gave his Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life.
