      In the Bible, we’re taught that we are created. God created us to have a
      relationship with Him, but Adam, our first father disobeyed God’s law.
      Because he did, we inherited his sin. Now there is a divide between God
      and man. 


      The Bible teaches that God is perfectly righteous and therefore, like a judge, he must convict those who are guilty of breaking His laws. Imagine looking at a person through a pane of glass. If the glass has mud all over it, you don’t see the beauty of that person, you see the mud. This is what it’s like when God looks at us. He sees our sins and because He is perfectly holy, he cannot accept us this way. Instead, he must judge our sins.

      However, Jesus came and lived the perfect life that Adam didn’t. He
      repaired the divide. It is by faith in what God has done, through Jesus
      Christ – the God/Man – that we are restored to a right relationship with
      God. Jesus took all the sin and judgment that each of us deserves and was
      crucified on a cross. In that moment he became our sin and our guilt.


      Now when we put our faith in Jesus Christ, God no longer sees our sin. Instead He sees Christ’s perfect obedience and righteousness. God has done all the work necessary for man to again live in His presence. The cross is the bridge that made this possible. It was at the greatest cost of all that man has been bought back from sin and death to eternal life through Jesus.

      There is none righteous, no, not one; Romans 3:10

      The Bible tells us that because we have a sin nature, we are unrighteous in God’s sight.


      – Don’t look to your own goodness to save you.


      …for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Romans 3:23 


      We all have sin in our hearts – it’s our very nature to sin. We all were born with sin and without Jesus we are under the power of sin’s control.


      – Admit that you are a sinner.

       For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23

      Sin results in death and we all face physical death, the result of sin.  But worse is our spiritually dead condition that has alienated us from God. Unless we’re reborn, it will last for all eternity.  The Bible clearly teaches there is a place called the Lake of Fire where lost people will be destroyed.   It’s the place where people who are spiritually dead will remain.


      – Understand that you deserve death for your sin.


      However, salvation is a gift from God to you!  You can’t earn this gift; instead you must reach out and receive it.
