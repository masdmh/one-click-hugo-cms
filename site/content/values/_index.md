      In the Bible, we’re taught that we are created. God created us to have a
      relationship with Him, but Adam, our first father disobeyed God’s law.
      Because he did, we inherited his sin. Now there is a divide between God
      and man.   God is perfectly righteous and therefore, like a judge, he must
      convict those who are guilty of breaking His laws. Imagine looking at a
      person through a pane of glass. If the glass has mud all over it, you
      don’t see the beauty of that person, you see the mud. This is what it’s
      like when God looks at us. He sees our sins and because He is perfectly
      holy, he cannot accept us this way. Instead, he must judge our sins.

    text: However, Jesus came and lived the perfect life that Adam didn’t. He
      repaired the divide. It is by faith in what God has done, through Jesus
      Christ – the God/Man – that we are restored to a right relationship with
      God. Jesus took all the sin and judgment that each of us deserves and was
      crucified on a cross. In that moment he became our sin and our guilt.

  - text: Now when we put our faith in Jesus Christ, God no longer sees our sin.
      Instead He sees Christ’s perfect obedience and righteousness. God has done
      all the work necessary for man to again live in His presence. The cross is
      the bridge that made this possible. It was at the greatest cost of all
      that man has been bought back from sin and death to eternal life through
      Jesus.
